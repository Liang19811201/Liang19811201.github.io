My name is Liang, and i come from China. I moved to Sweden 2007 for studying glass design in Nybro. Right now i work with E-commerce and study web programming, and dream about starting my own business and living in freedom. I love kitesurfing, snowboarding, biking and painting oil on carvas, as well sketching. I have a son who is 11 years old, he lives with me in Kalmar. I think after my son turns 18 i will be able to move to some place warm, so i can kitesurf, paint, and code some websites.
