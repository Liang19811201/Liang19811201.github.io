## Answers:
- What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?
 1. Compare to regular CSS:
 2. Which techniques did you use?
 3. Pros and cons?


  *To pre-compile my CSS needs an overview of the whole site design, to be aware of which styles are common and which are unique.*
  *Comparing to regular CSS, it has more structured way of orgnizing codes, less maintenance, but more files.*
  *I used the minima theme in my jekyll site, and changed the CSS inside the different files, made pretty usefull variables for colors*
  *Pros: less CSS to maintain, easy to change one place and be valid everywhere(variable), which leads to saved time. Better orgnized CSS: use mixins; nesting; separate in files. Cons: hard to debug the code, Line numbers in browser !== line numbers in source.*
