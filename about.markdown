My name is Liang, and i come from China. I moved to Sweden 2007 for studying glass design in Nybro. Right now i work with E-commerce and study web programming, and dream about starting my own business and live in freedom, so i can combine my work and hobby. I love kitesurfing, snowboarding, biking and painting oil on carvas. I have a son who is 11 years old, we live in Kalmar. So just wait until he turns 18, i will move to some place warm during winter time in Sweden.
