# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  My name is Liang, and i come from China. I moved to Sweden 2007 for studying glass design 
  in Nybro. Right now i work with E-commerce but dream about starting my own business and live 
  in freedom, so i can combine my work and hobby. I love kitesurfing, snowboarding, biking and 
  paiting oil on carvas. I have a son who is 11 years old, we live in Kalmar. So just wait until 
  he turns 18, i will move to some place warm during winter time in Sweden. 
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
